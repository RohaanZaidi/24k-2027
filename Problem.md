1. Create a branch with the name being your roll number
2. Create a problem.md file which contains an item list in which an algorithm is defined for finding even and odd numbers
3. Create a pull request and merge the request as well. [Attach screenshots]

 Objective 3: Algorithm (Task 01)
() Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). If so, determine if it’s an even number or odd number as well.

1.	SET Number and Divisor as 0
2.	Ask the user to enter Number
3.	Ask the user to enter Divisor
4.	SET Result = Number/Divisor
5.	IF Result is a decimal or outputs a remainder THEN PRINT “Valid Number and Divisor”
6.	ELSE PRINT “Invalid Number and Divisor”
7.	 IF Result/2 outputs a remainder or a decimal number THEN PRINT “Odd Result”
8.	ELSE PRINT “Even Result”
