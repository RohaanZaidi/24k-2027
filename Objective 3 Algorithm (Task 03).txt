Objective 3: Algorithm (Task 03)
() Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

1.	SET ‘+’ as 1
2.	SET ‘-‘ as 2
3.	SET ‘*’ as 3
4.	SET ‘/’ as 4
5.	SET ‘%’ as 5
6.	SET Num1 and Num2 as integers
7.	SET Result = 0
8.	Ask user to ENTER Num1 and Num2 in order of intended operations
9.	ENTER a number from 1-5, each number corresponding to a certain operation as SET above
10.	IF user enters 1, THEN Result = Num1 + Num2
11.	IF user enters 2, THEN Result = Num1 – Num2
12.	IF user enters 3, THEN Result = Num1 * Num2
13.	IF user enters 4, THEN Result = Num1 / Num2
14.	IF user enters 5, THEN Result = (Num1 / Num2)*100
15.	PRINT Result
